# 1-on-1s

## Calendar invite

This is an optional 1-on-1 for us to catch up in a more casual setting.

We can discuss about anything during this monthly catch-up (i.e., your projects, career, growth, personal life, needs, concerns, challenges, achievements, ideas, suggestions, feedback, rumours, etc.)

We will not cover status updates on projects and tasks—that is for stand-up.

Feel free to cancel any specific meeting if you feel that it’s not necessary. If not, we can have a chat anywhere you prefer, or a walk around somewhere.

Talk soon!
